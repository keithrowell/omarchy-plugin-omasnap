// reuse `EDITOR_CLASSES` without importing `snap.mjs` itself (which imports
// the adapter registry — a cycle).
//
// Pure ES module: no I/O, no imports.
//
// Recorded title samples (spike 0002's findings.md, Q3, plus a live
// `hyprctl activewindow -j` read taken during this build against a real
// project-open Zed window): a standalone Zed file (no project open) is
// `<file> — <file>` (em dash, U+2014, both halves the same). A real
// project-open window's title is `<project> — <file>` — **project first,
// file last** (the spike's own guess of `<file> — <project>` was wrong;
// corrected here from `omarchy_pacman — Board.js` and, dirty, `●
// omarchy_pacman — src/Board.js` — Zed keeps the file's path relative to
// the project root after the dash). VS Code's convention is `<file> -
// <folder> - Visual Studio Code` (hyphen, **file first**) — unaffected by
// the Zed correction above.
